HI ! This is my first and hopefully last Website Portfolio. To run it on your machine, do the following:

BACKEND setup (Thius sets up the APIs and Models made in Django) !
1. cd backend
2. cd amiel
3. scripts/activate
4. cd ..
5. cd backend
6. py manage.py runserver


FRONTEND setup
1. cd frontend
2. cd amielabadilla
3. npm run dev (for running locally)
